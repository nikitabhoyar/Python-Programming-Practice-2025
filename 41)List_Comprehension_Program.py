#List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values 
# of an existing list.

#Example:

#Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

#Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:

fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","custurdapple","mango"]

newlist = []

for x in fruits:
    if 'a' in x :
        newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

#With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:

#Example

fruits = ["apple","banana","grapes","watermelon","cherry","mango","kiwi","custardapple"]

newlist = [x for x in fruits if 'a']

print(newlist)

#############################################################################################################

#The Syntax

#newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

#The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

##############################################################################################################

# Condition
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that evaluate to True.

#Example
#Only accept items that are not "apple":

newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
print(newlist)
